		Waking Napster is a group of people that have enjoyed entertaining people all over the DelMarVa
		region for over 5 years. Playing high energy party music from the 90’s and 00’s, with a bit of
		70’s and 80’s mixed in for some good grooves. The goal of Waking Napster is to create a moment
		in time that everyone can join in together, forget and laugh your troubles away while singing
		and dancing to all your favorite songs. We love playing for all types of events and hope to see
		you at one of our shows or play for your event or venue sometime.
